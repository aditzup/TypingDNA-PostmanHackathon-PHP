This repository was created for the Postman API Hackathon.  https://postman-hack.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=home

The code is a demo and should not be used in production as it does not have a safe implementation. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the integration of the TypingDNA and SendGrid APIs for a free 2FA for small and medium companies.

This webiste can be run locally using XAMP or using a host domain. The demo is available on postmanhackathon.co.uk (for a limited time).

There are 2 changes requred in the backend.php to run the site. These are the API keys for typingdna.com and sendgrid.com. (A .env file will be added at some point, but this is a Hackathon Project)

For more questions please do not hesitate to get in touch.
